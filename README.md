# Jobify
My Jobify application was a private personal project. I am making it public to showcase my experience with a MERN stack.

In this application you can 
- register as a user.
- log in as an existing user
- create new jobs
- update existing jobs
- delete existing jobs
- view stats on the jobs
### Update .env file

```
PORT=4000
MONGO_URL=""
JWT_SECRET=
JWT_LIFETIME=1d
```

### Run The App Locally
under the client folder
`npm run install` and
at the root
`npm run install`


### Run
npm start
visit url http://localhost:3000/
